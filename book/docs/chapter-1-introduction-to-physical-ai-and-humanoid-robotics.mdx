--- title: Introduction to Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics ---

## Defining Physical AI: Embodiment, Interaction, and Intelligence
This section introduces the core concepts of Physical AI, emphasizing the importance of embodiment for intelligent systems to interact with and perceive the physical world. It will cover the distinction between purely digital AI and embodied AI, highlighting the unique challenges and opportunities that arise when AI systems have a physical presence.

## Defining Humanoid Robotics: History, Vision, and Goals
An overview of humanoid robotics will be provided, tracing its historical aspirations from ancient automata to modern research. The section will delve into the vision behind creating robots that mimic human form and capabilities, and outline the key goals, such as operating in human-centric environments, assisting humans, and exploring complex tasks that require human-like dexterity and locomotion.

## Interdisciplinary Nature: AI, Robotics, Control Systems, Materials Science
This part will stress the highly interdisciplinary nature of Physical AI and humanoid robotics. It will explain how successful development in this field requires a convergence of knowledge from artificial intelligence (machine learning, perception, cognitive architectures), classical robotics (kinematics, dynamics), advanced control systems, and cutting-edge materials science and mechanical engineering. Each discipline's contribution will be briefly outlined.

## Course Overview and Learning Objectives
Finally, this section will set the stage for the entire course, providing a high-level overview of the topics to be covered in subsequent chapters. It will articulate the key learning objectives that students are expected to achieve, including understanding fundamental theories, appreciating current technological advancements, and critically evaluating the societal implications of physical AI and humanoid robots.
