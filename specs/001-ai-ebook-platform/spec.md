# Feature Specification: OmniBook-AI Platform

**Feature Branch**: `001-ai-ebook-platform`
**Created**: 2025-11-27
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "/sp.specify

Project: OmniBook-AI

Goal:
Build an AI-generated e-book platform called **OmniBook-AI** that makes complex topics like **AI Agents, RAG Systems, and the Future of Books** easy to understand for beginners. The platform should include a structured table of contents, main content, and a “What’s on this page” section for each chapter, all auto-generated.

Core Features:
1. **AI-Generated Content**: Every topic, chapter, and section of the book should be generated automatically by AI, ensuring comprehensive coverage.
2. **Table of Contents**: Automatically create a clear, hierarchical table of contents based on the generated chapters and topics.
3. **Chapter Summary**: Each page/chapter should include a “What’s on this page” section summarizing key points for quick understanding.
4. **RAG-Powered Chatbot**:
   - Users can ask questions **only related to the book**.
   - Chatbot answers should **simplify complex concepts** and enhance user understanding.
   - Responses must be **accurate, backed by the book content**, and designed to maximize user satisfaction.
5. **User-Friendly Presentation**: Ensure that the book and chatbot interface are **easy to navigate** and beginner-friendly.

Constraints:
- All content is generated automatically; no manual input except for user questions.
- Chatbot must not hallucinate; strictly use RAG system to fetch accurate info from the book.
- Focus on **clarity, simplicity, and learning experience**.

Deliverables:
- Full AI-generated e-book (Markdown or HTML).
- Auto-generated table of contents.
- “What’s on this page” summaries for every chapter.
- RAG-backed chatbot integrated with the book content.
- Beginner-friendly, engaging interface.

End Goal:
Enable beginners to understand AI Agents, RAG systems, and the future of books effortlessly while providing **interactive learning** through the chatbot."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - AI-Generated Book Content (Priority: P1)

A beginner user wants to learn about complex topics like AI Agents, RAG Systems, and the Future of Books. They expect to access an e-book where all content, including topics, chapters, and sections, is automatically generated by AI to be comprehensive and easy to understand for someone new to these subjects.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundational feature for the entire platform, providing the core product value of AI-generated educational content. Without this, there is no e-book to interact with.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by generating an initial e-book on a specified topic and verifying its structure, content accuracy, and beginner-friendliness.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a new topic (e.g., "AI Agents"), **When** the system generates the e-book content, **Then** a comprehensive e-book covering the topic is produced, suitable for beginners.
2. **Given** a generated e-book, **When** reviewing its content, **Then** all chapters and sections are present and logically structured.
3. **Given** a complex concept within the generated content, **When** a beginner user reads it, **Then** the explanation is clear and easy to understand without prior domain knowledge.

### User Story 2 - Table of Contents & Chapter Summaries (Priority: P1)

A user browsing the OmniBook-AI platform wants to quickly navigate through the e-book and understand the main points of each chapter without reading everything. They expect an automatically generated, hierarchical table of contents and a concise "What's on this page" summary for every chapter.

**Why this priority**: This feature significantly enhances usability and learning efficiency, making the AI-generated content accessible and digestible for the target audience. It's critical for a good user experience.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by verifying the presence and accuracy of the table of contents and chapter summaries for a generated e-book.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a generated e-book, **When** the user views the e-book interface, **Then** a clear, hierarchical table of contents is displayed.
2. **Given** the user navigates to any chapter, **When** the chapter loads, **Then** a "What's on this page" section summarizing key points is prominently displayed.
3. **Given** the table of contents and chapter summaries, **When** the user reviews them, **Then** they accurately reflect the content and structure of the e-book.

### User Story 3 - RAG-Powered Chatbot (Priority: P1)

A beginner user reading the e-book encounters a concept they want to explore further or need a simplified explanation for. They expect to ask a chatbot a question, and the chatbot should provide an accurate, simplified response derived directly from the e-book content, without hallucinating.

**Why this priority**: This feature provides interactive learning, a core component of the platform's goal to enhance user understanding and engagement. It transforms passive reading into an active learning experience.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by asking specific questions related to a generated e-book's content and verifying the chatbot's responses for accuracy, simplicity, and adherence to the book's information.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user asks a question directly related to the e-book content, **When** the chatbot processes the query, **Then** it provides a simplified and accurate answer sourced from the book.
2. **Given** a user asks a question not related to the e-book content, **When** the chatbot processes the query, **Then** it politely indicates that it can only answer questions related to the book.
3. **Given** a complex concept in a user's question, **When** the chatbot responds, **Then** the explanation is broken down into easily digestible terms for beginners.
4. **Given** any user question, **When** the chatbot provides a response, **Then** the response contains no fabricated or unverified information (i.e., no hallucinations).

### Edge Cases

- **What happens when a topic is too complex for a beginner explanation, even after AI generation?**: The system should flag the content for review or provide a disclaimer about the advanced nature of the topic, while still attempting to simplify as much as possible.
- **How does the chatbot handle questions outside the book's scope?**: The chatbot must explicitly state that it can only answer questions related to the e-book content and avoid making up answers.
- **What if content generation fails or is incomplete for a chapter/section?**: The system should indicate the failure and prompt for a re-generation attempt, or mark the affected section as "under construction."
- **How does the system ensure the "What's on this page" summaries are truly concise and capture the main points without being redundant with the main content?**: The summary generation logic must be optimized for conciseness and distinctness from the primary text.
