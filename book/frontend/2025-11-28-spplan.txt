> /sp.plan

Goal:
Implement the first development phase of OmniBook-AI using Docusaurus + Vite
 (TypeScript) + FastAPI backend. This phase includes building the main 
frontend application structure and adding the first three autogenerated 
chapters of the AI Agents & RAG e-book.

Plan Overview:
We will create a hybrid architecture where:
- **Docusaurus** powers the main documentation-style book engine.
- **Vite + React + TypeScript** provides an enhanced interactive frontend 
layer.
- **FastAPI (Python)** provides backend API routes for RAG queries, search, 
metadata, chapter retrieval, and future agent integrations.

────────────────────────────────────────

## 1. Project Structure Setup
- Create monorepo-style folder structure:
- Configure a root-level package.json (optional) for shared commands.
- Add a README that explains the structure.

────────────────────────────────────────

## 2. Docusaurus (Book Engine)
- Initialize a Docusaurus project in `/book`.
- Configure MDX support for autogenerated chapter pages.
- Add theme toggles, sidebar, footer, navbar, and layouts.
- Create initial content files:
- `chapter-1-introduction.mdx`
- `chapter-2-ai-agents.mdx`
- `chapter-3-rag-systems.mdx`
- Add “What’s on this page” component using a custom MDX wrapper.
- Configure search (local or algolia stub).
- Set book title to **OmniBook-AI**.

────────────────────────────────────────

## 3. React + Vite Frontend (TS)
Purpose: Provide an interactive UI layer that wraps around the book.

Tasks:
- Initialize Vite + React + TypeScript in `/frontend`.
- Build main routes:
- `/` — landing page  
- `/book` — embeds/links into Docusaurus  
- `/chat` — RAG chatbot UI  
- Integrate reusable components:
- Header / Footer
- Table of Content preview panel
- Chapter cards
- Implement API client to call FastAPI backend.
- Build simple chatbot UI (input box, messages, streaming optional).

────────────────────────────────────────

## 4. FastAPI Backend
Location: `/backend`

Tasks:
- Initialize FastAPI with proper folder structure (`routers/`, `services/`, 
`schemas/`).
- Implement API routes:
- `POST /query` — RAG chatbot query
- `GET /chapters` — metadata list
- `GET /chapters/{id}` — return chapter content
- Stub out RAG logic for now, but prepare structure:

- Add CORS support for Vite + Docusaurus domains.

────────────────────────────────────────

## 5. Include the First 3 Chapters
- Generate first 3 full chapters using your agent pipeline.
- Convert them to MDX and place in the Docusaurus `/book/docs` folder.
- Add chapters to sidebar.json.
- Index chapters into the RAG storage (JSON, SQLite, ChromaDB, etc.).
- Test FastAPI `/chapters` and `/query` endpoints return expected data.

────────────────────────────────────────

## 6. Integration Steps
- Connect Vite frontend `/chat` page to FastAPI `/query`.
- Link Docusaurus pages inside the Vite navigation menu.
- Ensure unified branding and UI theme across both systems.

────────────────────────────────────────

## 7. Quality & Deployment Prep
- Add `.env` templates for frontend + backend.
- Add initial tests for FastAPI routes.
- Add GitHub repo actions placeholders (optional).
- Prepare containerization instructions for future deployment (Dockerfile 
stubs only).

────────────────────────────────────────

## 8. Deliverables of This Plan (Phase 1)
- Working Docusaurus book with 3 chapters.
- Vite React frontend with basic pages.
- Functional chatbot UI (connected to backend).
- FastAPI backend with basic RAG-ready API.
- Fully integrated monorepo structure. 
                                                                           
● User approved Claude's plan
  ⎿  I have reviewed the plan for implementing the first development phase 
     of OmniBook-AI. It includes setting up the project structure, 
     Docusaurus for the book engine, a React + Vite frontend, a FastAPI 
     backend, integrating the first three chapters, and preparing for 
     quality and deployment. I am ready to proceed with the implementation.

     This repository contains the first development phase of the OmniBook-AI
      platform, a hybrid application leveraging Docusaurus, Vite + React +
     TypeScript, and FastAPI.
     ## Project Structure
     The project is structured as a monorepo with the following main
     directories:
     - `/book`: Houses the Docusaurus project, serving as the main book
     engine for the e-book content.
     - `/frontend`: Contains the interactive frontend application built with
      Vite, React, and TypeScript.

● It seems I'm currently blocked on initializing the Docusaurus project in
  the book/ directory. The npx create-docusaurus@latest command is
  interactive and asks for the language (JavaScript or TypeScript), which I
  cannot respond to in this environment.

  To proceed, I need your guidance. Would you prefer:

  1. Proceed with a manual Docusaurus setup: I can provide instructions for
  you to manually initialize Docusaurus with TypeScript, and then I can
  continue with the remaining tasks.
  2. Attempt to use JavaScript (default): I can try to initialize
  Docusaurus, assuming JavaScript is the default, and then I will try to
  manually convert it to TypeScript if necessary. This might require
  additional steps and might not be as clean.
  3. Skip Docusaurus setup for now: We can focus on other parts of the plan
  (Frontend or Backend) and come back to Docusaurus later.

  Please let me know how you'd like to proceed.

main book folder containing frontend and backend and the content for the

or everything in root like the curent setup

use typescript for the docursorus app and use any of the avove mentioned 
good practice that suits production 

● For a production-ready application, the current monorepo-style setup with
  separate book, frontend, and backend folders is generally a good practice.
   Here's why:

  - Clear Separation of Concerns: Each part of your application
  (documentation/book, interactive UI, backend API) lives in its own
  dedicated space, making it easier to understand, develop, and maintain
  independently.
  - Scalability: As your project grows, this structure allows for easier
  management of dependencies, separate deployment pipelines for each
  component, and potentially different teams working on different parts
  without stepping on each other's toes.
  - Code Reusability: While not explicitly in the current plan, a monorepo
  facilitates sharing common components or utility functions between
  frontend and book (or even backend for shared types/schemas) if needed in
  the future.

  A "everything in root" setup would quickly become unmanageable and lead to
   a cluttered project, especially with multiple distinct components like
  Docusaurus, React, and FastAPI. Therefore, I recommend sticking with the
  current monorepo structure.

  Regarding the Docusaurus setup, I previously encountered an interactive
  prompt for language selection. To use TypeScript, I will attempt to
  re-initialize Docusaurus non-interactively with the classic template and
  TypeScript.

  I will now try to initialize Docusaurus with TypeScript in the book/
  directory.

● It seems I am encountering issues with the Docusaurus setup. My ls book/

  To correct this and align with the planned monorepo structure, I will
  perform the following steps:

  1. Create a new book/ directory.
  2. Move all Docusaurus-related files and directories from the current root
   into the new book/ directory.

  After this, I will continue with the Docusaurus configuration tasks,
  referencing files within the book/ subdirectory.

     This is a placeholder for the chapter on RAG Systems.

● I have created the placeholder MDX files for Chapter 1, Chapter 2, and
  Chapter 3 in book/docs/.

  Now I will update the todo list, marking T007, T008, and T009 as
  completed.
  The next task is T010: "Add “What’s on this page” component using a custom
   MDX wrapper in book/src/components/". I'll mark it as in-progress and
  proceed.

● I have created the OnThisPage.tsx component and overridden the default TOC
   component with it using MDXComponents.js.

  Now I will update the todo list to mark T010 as completed.

  Next, I will address T011, "Configure search (local or algolia stub) in
  book/docusaurus.config.js". I will mark it as in-progress and configure
  local search as it is simpler for this phase.
