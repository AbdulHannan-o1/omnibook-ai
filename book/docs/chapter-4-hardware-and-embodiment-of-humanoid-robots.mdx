## Mechanical Design: Body Structures, Degrees of Freedom
This section will delve into the mechanical design principles unique to humanoid robots. It will cover the design of bipedal body structures, emphasizing stability, balance, and efficient locomotion. The concept of Degrees of Freedom (DoF) will be thoroughly explained, detailing how the number and arrangement of joints influence a robot's dexterity and range of motion, particularly in mimicking human movements.

## Materials Science in Robotics: Lightweighting, Durability, Compliance
An exploration of the crucial role of materials science in humanoid robot development will be presented. This section will discuss the selection of materials for lightweighting (to reduce energy consumption and inertia), ensuring durability (for longevity and robustness), and achieving compliance (for safe human interaction and adaptability to uncertain environments). Examples of advanced composites, alloys, and soft materials will be included.

## Power Systems: Batteries, Energy Efficiency
This part will focus on the complex challenges of powering humanoid robots. It will cover various power sources, with a primary emphasis on battery technologies and their limitations in terms of energy density and discharge rates. Strategies for maximizing energy efficiency, including regenerative braking, optimized locomotion gaits, and low-power component selection, will also be discussed.

## Computational Hardware: Onboard Processing, Distributed Systems
This section will examine the computational architecture of humanoid robots. It will discuss the need for powerful onboard processing units to handle complex sensor data, real-time control algorithms, and AI computations. The concept of distributed control systems, where processing tasks are spread across multiple specialized microcontrollers or FPGAs, will be introduced to enhance responsiveness and modularity.

## Sensory Systems Integration: Vision, Force, Touch
Finally, this section will detail the integration of diverse sensory systems within the humanoid robot's physical structure. It will explain how data from vision sensors (cameras), force-torque sensors (in wrists and ankles), and tactile sensors (on fingertips and body) are fused and processed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the robot's own state and its interaction with the environment. Challenges in sensor placement and data interpretation will be highlighted.
