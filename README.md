## Project Structure

The project is structured as a monorepo with the following main directories:

- `/book`: Houses the Docusaurus project, serving as the main book engine for the e-book content.
- `/frontend`: Contains the interactive frontend application built with Vite, React, and TypeScript.
- `/backend`: Implements the FastAPI backend, providing APIs for RAG queries, chapter retrieval, and other services.
