## Prompt

/sp.clarify

## Response snapshot

Five critical ambiguities have been clarified and recorded in the spec.

**Number of questions asked & answered**: 5
**Path to updated spec**: `/home/abdulhannan/data/development/openAi/e-book/specs/001-ai-ebook-platform/spec.md`
**Sections touched**:
*   Clarifications
*   Key Entities
*   Functional Requirements
*   Non-Functional Requirements (new section added with Performance, Observability, and Security & Privacy subsections)

**Coverage Summary**:

| Category | Status |
| :--- | :--- |
| Functional Scope & Behavior | Clear |
| Domain & Data Model | Resolved |
| Interaction & UX Flow | Clear |
| Non-Functional Quality Attributes | Resolved |
| Integration & External Dependencies | Resolved |
| Edge Cases & Failure Handling | Clear |
| Constraints & Tradeoffs | Clear |
| Terminology & Consistency | Clear |
| Completion Signals | Clear |
| Misc / Placeholders | Clear |

The specification now has a clearer foundation. You can proceed to define the architectural plan.
**Suggested next command**: `/sp.plan`

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Clarified key architectural and non-functional aspects of the OmniBook-AI platform specification.
- 🧪 Tests: No new tests, but clarifications will inform future test design.
- 📁 Files: Updated `spec.md` with clarifications and new non-functional requirements.
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.plan
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully clarified critical ambiguities, enabling a more informed planning phase.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)
