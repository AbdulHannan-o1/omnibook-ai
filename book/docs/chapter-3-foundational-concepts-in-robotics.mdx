## Kinematics: Forward and Inverse Kinematics
This section will introduce the fundamental concepts of robot kinematics, which deals with the geometry of motion without considering forces. It will explain forward kinematics (determining end-effector position from joint angles) and inverse kinematics (determining joint angles for a desired end-effector position), emphasizing their critical role in robot control and path planning.

## Dynamics: Equations of Motion, Lagrangian and Newtonian Approaches
Moving beyond geometry, this part will cover robot dynamics, which analyzes the relationship between forces/torques and motion. It will discuss the equations of motion and introduce both Newtonian and Lagrangian approaches to deriving these equations, essential for understanding how forces affect robot movement and for developing effective control strategies.

## Control Theory: PID Control, State Space, Optimal Control
This section will provide an overview of key control theory concepts applied in robotics. It will explain Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control as a widely used method, introduce state-space representation for complex systems, and touch upon optimal control techniques that aim to achieve desired performance objectives while minimizing energy or time.

## Sensors and Perception: Proprioception, Exteroception (Vision, Lidar, Tactile)
This part will explore the diverse range of sensors used in robotics for perceiving the environment and the robot's own state. It will differentiate between proprioceptive sensors (internal state, e.g., joint encoders, IMUs) and exteroceptive sensors (external environment, e.g., cameras for vision, LiDAR for distance, tactile sensors for touch), explaining their principles and applications.

## Actuators and Joint Design: Motors, Servos, Hydraulics, Pneumatics
Finally, this section will cover the mechanisms responsible for robot movement: actuators. It will discuss various types of actuators, including electric motors (DC, stepper, servo), hydraulic systems (for high force applications), and pneumatic systems (for compliance and lightweight design), along with the principles of efficient and robust joint design in humanoid robots.
